		Darcs is a free, open source revision control
		system. It is:
		
		* Distributed: Every user has access to the full
		command set, removing boundaries between server and
		client or committer and non-committers.
		
		* Interactive: Darcs is easy to learn and efficient to
		use because it asks you questions in response to
		simple commands, giving you choices in your work
		flow. You can choose to record one change in a file,
		while ignoring another. As you update from upstream,
		you can review each patch name, even the full &quot;diff&quot;
		for interesting patches.
		
		* Smart: Originally developed by physicist David
		Roundy, darcs is based on a unique algebra of
		patches.
		
		This smartness lets you respond to changing demands
		in ways that would otherwise not be possible. Learn
		more about spontaneous branches with darcs.
		
		* Please note that hackage does not correctly display
		the license. It is meant to be &quot;GPL-2.0-or-later&quot;.
