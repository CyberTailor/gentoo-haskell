		Shellac is a framework for building read-eval-print style shells.
		Shells are created by declaratively defining a set of shell commands
		and an evaluation function.  Shellac supports multiple shell backends,
		including a &#39;basic&#39; backend which uses only Haskell IO primitives and
		a full featured &#39;readline&#39; backend based on the the Haskell readline
		bindings found in the standard libraries.
		This library attempts to allow users to write shells at a high level
		and still enjoy the advanced features that may be available from a
		powerful line editing package like readline.
