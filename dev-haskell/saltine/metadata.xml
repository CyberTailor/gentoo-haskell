		/NaCl/ (pronounced \&quot;salt\&quot;) is a new easy-to-use high-speed software
		library for network communication, encryption, decryption,
		signatures, etc. NaCl&#39;s goal is to provide all of the core
		operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.
		
		&lt;http://nacl.cr.yp.to/&gt;
		
		/Sodium/ is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable
		crypto library based on NaCl, with a compatible API.
		
		&lt;https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium&gt;
		
		/Saltine/ is a Haskell binding to the NaCl primitives going through
		Sodium for build convenience and, eventually, portability.
