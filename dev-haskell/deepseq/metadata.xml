		This package provides methods for fully evaluating data structures
		(\&quot;deep evaluation\&quot;). Deep evaluation is often used for adding
		strictness to a program, e.g. in order to force pending exceptions,
		remove space leaks, or force lazy I/O to happen. It is also useful
		in parallel programs, to ensure pending work does not migrate to the
		wrong thread.
		
		The primary use of this package is via the &#39;deepseq&#39; function, a
		\&quot;deep\&quot; version of &#39;seq&#39;. It is implemented on top of an &#39;NFData&#39;
		typeclass (\&quot;Normal Form Data\&quot;, data structures with no unevaluated
		components) which defines strategies for fully evaluating different
		data types.
