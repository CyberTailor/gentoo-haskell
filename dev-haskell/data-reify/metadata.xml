		&#39;data-reify&#39; provided the ability to turn recursive structures into explicit graphs.
		Many (implicitly or explicitly) recursive data structure can be given this ability, via
		a type class instance. This gives an alternative to using &#39;Ref&#39; for observable sharing.
		
		Observable sharing in general is unsafe, so we use the IO monad to bound this effect,
		but can be used safely even with &#39;unsafePerformIO&#39; if some simple conditions are met.
		Typically this package will be used to tie the knot with DSL&#39;s that depend of
		observable sharing, like Lava.
		
		Providing an instance for &#39;MuRef&#39; is the mechanism for allowing a structure to be
		reified into a graph, and several examples of this are provided.
