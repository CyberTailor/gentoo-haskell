		This is an implementation of Cloud Haskell, as described in
		/Towards Haskell in the Cloud/ by Jeff Epstein, Andrew Black,
		and Simon Peyton Jones
		(&lt;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/parallel/&gt;),
		although some of the details are different. The precise message
		passing semantics are based on /A unified semantics for future Erlang/
		by&#9;Hans Svensson, Lars-Ã…ke Fredlund and Clara Benac Earle.
		You will probably also want to install a Cloud Haskell backend such
		as distributed-process-simplelocalnet.
