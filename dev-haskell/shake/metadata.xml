		Shake is a Haskell library for writing build systems - designed as a
		replacement for @make@. See &quot;Development.Shake&quot; for an introduction,
		including an example. The homepage contains links to a user
		manual, an academic paper and further information:
		&lt;https://shakebuild.com&gt;
		
		To use Shake the user writes a Haskell program
		that imports &quot;Development.Shake&quot;, defines some build rules, and calls
		the &#39;Development.Shake.shakeArgs&#39; function. Thanks to do notation and infix
		operators, a simple Shake build system
		is not too dissimilar from a simple Makefile. However, as build systems
		get more complex, Shake is able to take advantage of the excellent
		abstraction facilities offered by Haskell and easily support much larger
		projects. The Shake library provides all the standard features available in other
		build systems, including automatic parallelism and minimal rebuilds.
		Shake also provides more accurate dependency tracking, including seamless
		support for generated files, and dependencies on system information
		(e.g. compiler version).
