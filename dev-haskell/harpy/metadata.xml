		The package contains the following components:
		
		* An x86 assembler.  We provide both low-level code generation in
		module &quot;Harpy.X86CodeGen&quot; as well as a (slightly) higher-level
		implementation in module &quot;Harpy.X86Assembler&quot;, which figures out
		addressing modes based on an instruction&#39;s operand types.
		
		* An x86 disassembler which knows most of the opcodes available on
		modern x86 processors and can display its output both in the style
		used in Intel documents an in AT&amp;T style, like the GNU tools. The
		disassembler can be found in module &quot;Harpy.X86Disassembler&quot;.  The
		disassembler is re-exported from the disassembler package for
		compatibility with earlier Harpy releases.
		
		* Some abstractions over the abovementioned code generation modules,
		such as automatic label management and code generation
		combinators (for if-then-else statements, while-loops, functions)
		(module &quot;Harpy.X86CGCombinators&quot;).
		
		* All the above modules use the code generation monad defined in module
		&quot;Harpy.CodeGenMonad&quot;.
		
		* The Darcs repo and two tutorials on using Harpy can be found at
		Harpy&#39;s homepage: &lt;http://uebb.cs.tu-berlin.de/harpy/&gt;
