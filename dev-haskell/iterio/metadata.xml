		Iteratee-based IO is an alternative to lazy IO that offers
		better error handling, referential transparency, and
		convenient composition of protocol layers or parsers.  This
		package provides iteratees based around /pipe/ operators for
		hooking together application components and directing data
		flow.  New users should see the tutorial in the &quot;Data.IterIO&quot;
		module documentation.  Highlights of the library include:
		
		* Heavy emphasis on ease of use, ease of learning, and
		uniformity of mechanism.
		
		* Copious documentation.
		
		* Consistent EOF and error handling to avoid resource leaks
		and other issues in corner cases.
		
		* A set of iteratee parsing combinators providing LL(*)
		parsing while generally not consuming large amounts of
		memory for backtracking.
		
		* Seamless integration with attoparsec for LL(1) parsing.
		
		See &quot;Data.IterIO&quot; for a discussion of the differences between
		iterIO and the two previous iteratee implementations (iteratee
		and enumerator).
