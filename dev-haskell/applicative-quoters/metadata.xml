		Quasiquoters taken from Matt Morrow&#39;s haskell-src-meta to implement
		Conor McBride&#39;s idiom brackets, and a do-notation that only requires
		Applicative (and is correspondingly less powerful).
		
		applicative-quoters currently has no maintainer: if it is broken and
		you want it to be fixed, then fix it!
