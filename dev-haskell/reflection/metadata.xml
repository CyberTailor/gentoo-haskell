		This package addresses the /configuration problem/ which is
		propagating configurations that are available at run-time, allowing
		multiple configurations to coexist without resorting to mutable
		global variables or &#39;System.IO.Unsafe.unsafePerformIO&#39;.
		
		That package is an implementation of the ideas presented in the
		paper \&quot;Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations\&quot; by Oleg Kiselyov
		and Chung-chieh Shan (&lt;http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/tr-15-04.pdf original paper&gt;).
		However, the API has been streamlined to improve performance.
		
		Austin Seipp&#39;s tutorial &lt;https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/thoughtpolice/using-reflection Reflecting values to types and back&gt; provides a summary of the
		approach taken by this library, along with more motivating examples.
