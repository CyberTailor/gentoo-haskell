		@angel@ is a daemon that runs and monitors other processes.  It
		is similar to djb&#39;s `daemontools` or the Ruby project `god`.
		
		It&#39;s goals are to keep a set of services running, and to facilitate
		the easy configuration and restart of those services.
		See the homepage for documentation.
