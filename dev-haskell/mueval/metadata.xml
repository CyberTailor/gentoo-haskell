		Mueval is a Haskell interpreter. It
		uses the GHC API to evaluate arbitrary Haskell expressions.
		Importantly, mueval takes many precautions to defang and avoid \&quot;evil\&quot;
		code.  It uses resource limits, whitelisted modules,
		special Show instances for IO, threads, processes, changes of directory, and so
		on to sandbox the Haskell code.
		
		It is, in short, intended to be a standalone version of Lambdabot&#39;s famous
		evaluation functionality. For examples and explanations, please see the README file.
		
		Mueval is POSIX-only.
