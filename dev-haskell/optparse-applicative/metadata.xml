		optparse-applicative is a haskell library for parsing options
		on the command line, and providing a powerful applicative
		interface for composing them.
		
		optparse-applicative takes care of reading and validating the
		arguments passed to the command line, handling and reporting
		errors, generating a usage line, a comprehensive help screen,
		and enabling context-sensitive bash, zsh, and fish completions.
		
		See the included README for detailed instructions and examples,
		which is also available on github
		&lt;https://github.com/pcapriotti/optparse-applicative&gt;.
