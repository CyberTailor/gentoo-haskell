		This package consists of several modules, that give a
		pure specification of functions in the IO monad:
		
		* &quot;Test.IOSpec.Fork&quot;: a pure specification of
		&#39;forkIO&#39;.
		
		* &quot;Test.IOSpec.IORef&quot;: a pure specification of most
		functions that create and manipulate on &#39;IORefs&#39;.
		
		* &quot;Test.IOSpec.MVar&quot;: a pure specification of most
		functions that create and manipulate and &#39;MVars&#39;.
		
		* &quot;Test.IOSpec.STM&quot;: a pure specification of
		&#39;atomically&#39; and the &#39;STM&#39; monad.
		
		* &quot;Test.IOSpec.Teletype&quot;: a pure specification of
		&#39;getChar&#39;, &#39;putChar&#39;, and several related
		Prelude functions.
		
		Besides these modules containing the specifications,
		there are a few other important modules:
		
		* &quot;Test.IOSpec.Types&quot;: defines the &#39;IOSpec&#39; type and
		several amenities.
		
		* &quot;Test.IOSpec.VirtualMachine&quot;: defines a virtual
		machine on which to execute pure specifications.
		
		* &quot;Test.IOSpec.Surrogate&quot;: a drop-in replacement for
		the other modules. Import this and recompile your
		code once you&#39;ve finished testing and debugging.
		
		There are several well-documented examples included
		with the source distribution.
