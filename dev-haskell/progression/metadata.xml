		Progression is a library that builds on the criterion
		benchmarking library.  It stores the results of running
		your benchmarks and graphs the performance of different
		versions of your program against each other.  See the
		&quot;Progression.Main&quot; module, and the original blog post at
		&lt;http://chplib.wordpress.com/2010/02/04/progression-supporting-optimisation-in-haskell/&gt;
		to get started, as well as the later post &lt;http://chplib.wordpress.com/2010/03/02/progression-0-3-bar-charts-and-normalisation/&gt;.
