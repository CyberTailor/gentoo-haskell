		This package contains bindings to the Wayland library, which is used to interface display devices, drawable clients, and window managers.
		
		Wayland exposes a &quot;fixed&quot; set of functions, and additionally generates a part of its API from a &quot;protocol&quot; file.
		This package locates that protocol file using pkg-config.
		
		If you want to interface with other protocols (such as Weston&#39;s), refer to the readme for instructions.
