		This package provides a type class
		to handle signed and unsigned samples
		of various size and number of channels in a uniform way.
		
		We expect that you use the types &#39;Int8&#39;, &#39;Word8&#39; and so on
		for monophonic samples and thus provide instances of the class for them.
		Further we define Stereo record and mu-law sample type.
		Quadrophony can be achieved by nested Stereo value,
		but I&#39;m uncertain, whether this is a good way to go.
		Maybe we add 5+1 channels or so in future.
		
		This is used by packages @sox@, @alsa@, @synthesizer@.
