		This library provides the core data types and functions
		for parsing commonmark (&lt;https://spec.commonmark.org&gt;).
		The parser is fully commonmark-compliant and passes the test
		suite.  It is designed to be customizable and easily extensible.
		To customize the output, create an AST, or support a new output
		format, one need only define some new typeclass instances.
		It is also easy to add new syntax elements or modify existing ones.
		
		Accurate information about source positions is available
		for all block and inline elements.  Thus the library can be
		used to create an accurate syntax highlighter or
		an editor with live preview.
		
		The parser has been designed for robust performance
		even in pathological cases that tend to cause stack overflows or
		exponential slowdowns in other parsers, with parsing speed that
		varies linearly with input length.
		
		Related packages:
		
		- commonmark-extensions (which defines a number of syntax extensions)
		- commonmark-pandoc (which allows using this parser to create a Pandoc
		structure)
		- commonmark-cli (a command-line tool for converting and
		syntax-highlighting commonmark documents)
