		Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
		library.  It is simple, safe, well-known, has extensive libraries,
		good error messages, and is also fast.
		
		This package is the core haskell98 part of the parsec2
		package as originally created by Daan Leijen. It is intended to
		preserve its simplicity and portability.
		
		This version differs from the pervious one only by a MonadFail
		instance to let it compile with ghc-8.8.
