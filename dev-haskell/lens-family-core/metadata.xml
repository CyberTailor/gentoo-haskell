		This package provides first class( ) functional references.
		In addition to the usual operations of getting, setting and composition, plus integration with the state monad, lens families provide some unique features:
		
		* Polymorphic updating
		
		* Traversals
		
		* Cast projection functions to read-only lenses
		
		* Cast \&quot;toList\&quot; functions to read-only traversals
		
		* Cast semantic editor combinators to modify-only traversals.
		
		( ) For optimal first-class support use the @lens-family@ package with rank 2 / rank N polymorphism.
		&quot;Lens.Family.Clone&quot; allows for first-class support of lenses and traversals for those who require Haskell 98.
