		This library provides a powerful but simple way to measure software
		performance.  It provides both a framework for executing and
		analysing benchmarks and a set of driver functions that makes it
		easy to build and run benchmarks, and to analyse their results.
		
		The fastest way to get started is to read the
		&lt;http://www.serpentine.com/criterion/tutorial.html online tutorial&gt;,
		followed by the documentation and examples in the &quot;Criterion.Main&quot;
		module.
		
		For examples of the kinds of reports that criterion generates, see
		&lt;http://www.serpentine.com/criterion the home page&gt;.
