		Haskellers are usually familiar with monoids and semigroups. A monoid has an appending operation `&lt;&gt;` (or `mappend`),
		and an identity element, `mempty`. A semigroup has an appending `&lt;&gt;` operation, but does not require a `mempty` element.
		
		A Semiring has two appending operations, `plus` and `times`, and two respective identity elements, `zero` and `one`.
		
		More formally, a Semiring R is a set equipped with two binary relations `+` and `*`, such that:
		
		(R,+) is a commutative monoid with identity element 0,
		
		(R,*) is a monoid with identity element 1,
		
		(*) left and right distributes over addition, and
		
		multiplication by &#39;0&#39; annihilates R.
