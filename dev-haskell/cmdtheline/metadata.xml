		CmdTheLine aims to remove tedium from the definition of command-line
		programs, producing usage and help with little effort.
		
		The inspiration was found in Daniel Bunzli&#39;s
		&lt;http://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner&gt; library.
		
		CmdTheLine uses applicative functors to provide a declarative, compositional
		mechanism for defining command-line programs by lifting regular Haskell
		functions over argument parsers.
		
		A tutorial can be found at
		&lt;http://elifrey.com/2012/07/23/CmdTheLine-Tutorial/&gt;.
		
		Suggestions, comments, and bug reports are appreciated. Please see the
		bug and issue tracker at &lt;http://github.com/eli-frey/cmdtheline&gt;.
		
		Changes since 0.1:
		
		* More type safety: Types in CmdTheLine.Arg have been made more explicit to
		disalow unwanted behavior.  Positional argument information and optional
		argument information are distinguished from each other.  As well &#39;Arg&#39;s must
		be transformed into &#39;Term&#39; before use, as some operations make since to
		perform on &#39;Arg&#39; but not on &#39;Term&#39;.
		
		* ArgVal has only one method: &#39;parser&#39; and &#39;pp&#39; have been fused into a tuple, so
		that instantiation of &#39;ArgVal&#39; can be simplified for all parties.
		
		* Err is an instance of MonadIO:  The &#39;Err&#39; monad now supports IO action.
		
		* File and Directory path validation:  Taking advantage of new &#39;Err&#39;
		capabilities, the library provides new functions for validating &#39;String&#39;s
		inside of &#39;Term&#39;s as being valid\/existent file\/directory paths.
		
		Changes since 0.2.0:
		
		* Test friendly &#39;unwrap&#39; functions:  To allow the testing of terms, there are
		now two new functions exported with System.Console.CmdTheLine.Term, &#39;unwrap&#39;
		and &#39;unwrapChoice&#39;.  As well a datatype representing cause of early exit,
		&#39;EvalExit&#39; is exported.
