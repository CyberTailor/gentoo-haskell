		Taffybar is a gtk+3 (through gi-gtk) based desktop information bar, intended
		primarily for use with XMonad, though it can also function alongside other EWMH
		compliant window managers. It is similar in spirit to xmobar, but it differs in
		that it gives up some simplicity for a reasonable helping of eye candy.
